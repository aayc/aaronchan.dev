The Chaos Monkey is a tool created by Netflix to make sure their systems were resilient. Basically the Chaos Monkey a digital monkey that will randomly crash part of your system. It could crash the database, a streaming node, a load balancer, etc. The Chaos monkey does whatever it wants.

<br />
Sounds like a real pain to the development process right? Well, it forced engineers
to think through, plan for, and build around what happens if they happen to be next
on the Chaos monkeyâ€™s chopping block. As a result, in production, the system is not
just ready for but actually built for spontaneous crashes.
