The CAP Theorem is one of the most important findings in the distributed computing field. It states that when you have a data store like a database, you can only provide two out of the following three guarantees: consistency, availability and partition tolerance.

<br />
Consistency means every time you read data, it’s always the most recent version.
<br />
Availability means that the system is ready for you to query it.
<br />
Partition tolerance means that messages can be dropped or delayed and the system
will continue to operate.
<br />
Why can we be sure you can only have two out of three? Because in the event that
messages/information is dropped due to network problems or some kind of crashing,
you need to decide whether to cancel the operation and preserve consistency (but
sacrifice availability) or just try it anyway and preserve availability (but risk
inconsistency).
<br />
If you don’t have partitions then you can have both consistency and availability.
But the theory still holds because you wouldn’t need to worry about partition tolerance.
