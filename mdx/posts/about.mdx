Welcome to my website! I grew up in upstate New York in the same house for the first 18 years of my life until I moved out to attend school out in Utah. I studied Computer Science and Applied Statistics as a dual major at Brigham Young University and I loved building random, fun, whimsical [projects](/projects) while I was there.

(TODO picture of me or something)

<br />
I joined [Microsoft Research](/projects/msft-research) in August of 2021 as a Software
Engineer and Data Scientist and have been spending my time developing AI models for
bug detection. On the side, I enjoy playing the piano and occasionally the cello.
I also like to cook, train in Jiu Jitsu, and study languages like Mandarin Chinese
and Spanish. I am an aspiring traveler and hope to make it back to the land where
my parents were born: Hong Kong. I love reading books. It makes me happy to have
genuine conversations about things that matter to people.
<br />
I'm passionate about keeping the Earth a habitable place for all of us; I believe
that building additional housing will alleviate a lot of problems; I support equal
rights for all. I cherish the relationships I've made so far in my life with my family
and friends. I'm always seeking to grow my perspective and learn new things. I'm
grateful for all the amazing people in my life.
<br />
