Finally writing this down. To install NVIDIA drivers on a new Ubuntu machine, first get the `ubuntu-drivers` package:
<br />
```bash
sudo apt install ubuntu-drivers-common
```

Then, run the following command to get a list of available drivers:
<br />
```bash
ubuntu-drivers devices
```

You should see something like this:
<br />
```bash
== /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:01.0/0000:01:00.0 ==
modalias : pci:v000010DEd00001C03sv00001028sd0000086Bbc03sc00i00
vendor   : NVIDIA Corporation
model    : GP106M [GeForce GTX 1060 Mobile]
driver   : nvidia-driver-390 - distro non-free recommended
driver   : nvidia-driver-418 - distro non-free
driver   : nvidia-driver-430 - distro non-free
driver   : nvidia-driver-435 - distro non-free
```

Then, install the driver you want (generally the recommended one):

```bash
sudo apt install nvidia-driver-390
```

Then, reboot your machine:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

After rebooting, you can check that the driver is installed by running:

```bash
nvidia-smi
```
