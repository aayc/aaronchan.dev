Currently I work for Microsoft Research on AI models to detect bugs in source code. It's kind of meta - I'm a developer for other developers. Our team owns products like Azure Notebooks, VS Code and Visual Studio, multiple Visual Studio Code extensions, Azure PowerShell, we often partner with Github - it's the Developer Division.

<br />
What I like most about my position is that it‚Äôs on a research team but also a product
team, we invent and ship new products based on cutting edge research. I constantly
hear new ideas based on the latest research and I‚Äôm stretched to pitch ideas back
and implement new products. I think it‚Äôs also rare to find a research team with deployment
experience at scales. Lately I‚Äôve been working primarily on AI models for bug detection.
<br />
Creating the dataset and model architecture is just the first step; there is also
creating the engineering platform, figuring out the user experience, dogfooding,
telemetry, deployment and ultimately shipping as a product, whether internally to
Microsoft‚Äôs sizeable engineering team or externally to the world.
<br />
All in all, Microsoft so far has been a great opportunity to expand my research and
engineering skills and both imagine and create products from the ground up.
