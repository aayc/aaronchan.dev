Matchmaker was one of the most wild projects I've worked on. During my 5th semester at BYU, I met some students from Stanford who were doing classes remotely but near BYU (Stanford was remote, BYU is very social). They told me about a survey that happens at Stanford called the Stanford Marriage Pact; apparently it uses an algorithm to identify your "best match" and then you make a pact that if neither of you are married by the time you're 35 or something like that then you'll get married. It's mostly just for fun and I don't know if anyone's actually gotten married from it.

<br />
Well, BYU is famously marriage-happy, so we thought it would be fun to do something
like the Stanford Marriage Pact but at BYU. We made around 50 questions ranging from
asking about political beliefs, to ideal future family size, to whether you'd rather
explore the deep sea or space, and spread more than 5,000 flyers around BYU campus.
A friend and I wrote the website, and I wrote the backend infrastructure that would
handle and process the surveys. I also wrote our matching algorithm, which essentially
just matched people based on similarity scores for most questions and a few custom
scores for the other questions.
<br />
We opened the survey for 2 weeks, had everyone take it, and then closed the survey,
created the matches, and emailed every person exactly one match. If A matched with
B then B also matched with A. We had to account for the imbalance between the number
of boys and girls, sexual orientation, age ranges, and much more. More than 5,000
students took the survey and, get this, roughly 0.5% got MARRIED. Isn't that insane?
We specifically put on the survey, "hey this is sort of a joke and don't marry your
match right away" but it turned out that for some people, it really was right.
<br />I ran a second round of Matchmaker the following winter, with local company
sponsors, a second university, and algorithm's capability to return 4 matches per
person. It was similarly successful, but at this point I was done with the dating
app scene and decided to move on to other projects. Matchmaker will always have a
fond place in my heart for the rush of being a part of so many people's dating lives.
