In May of 2020, Mikayla and I came up with a new project idea: Tiedye. We had seen many students at our university struggling to find friends in the midst of the pandemic. People were online all the time but it was becoming clear that online communities were really spread out - Instagram and Facebook were not personable and frankly, not even cool anymore.

<br />
So we thought of a new idea for a social network:

<br />
<ol
  className="ml-4"
  style={{ "list-style-type": "decimal", "margin-left": "20px" }}
>
  <li>
    Only college students of your own university are allowed, so everyone you
    see on the app is a student like you.
  </li>
  <li>
    The focus is on passions and interests rather than posts and pictures.
  </li>
  <li>
    We wanted people to actually have meaningful conversations 1:1 and in
    groups.
  </li>
</ol>

<br />
Thus, Tiedye was born. It was a cross-platform app where you would use your university
email to gain access to your campus' Tiedye. You'd select from over 10,000 "tags"
to showcase your interests, ranging from "piano ðŸŽ¹" to "the bachelor ðŸŒ¹". You could
form and join communities by combining tags, e.g. "asian", "food" would create the
Asian Food community, which had its own posts, group chat, events, polls, and more.
You could submit events on the app to be shown to students who shared your interests.
And most important, we created the Tiedye Question Game, which promoted meaningful
conversation by literally pitching the questions and having both parties answer them
to get to know each other.

<br />
We won a few competitions and joined an incubator at our university, and I took some
time off in the summer to focus on writing the app. We bought thousands of stickers,
ordered hundreds of shirts and printed hundreds of flyers to spread around UC Berkeley
and Brigham Young University. We onboarded hundreds of students who joined communities,
chatted individually and in groups, and met up in person. It was a success, and we
were thrilled to see how the app soared from a prototype to a fully-fledged product.

<br />
Regarding revenue, we partnered with local businesses to advertise group discounts,
like Groupon, where we would take a small percentage of the fees. We had local businesses
lining up who wanted to get in on the student market, and we built a platform for
them to submit discount opportunities and track usage.

<br />
In August of 2021, we had around 20 people working for us; mostly volunteer students
who loved the idea of Tiedye and were willing to be ambassadors on their campuses
to spread it around. We had a ton of fun meeting them and dreaming together about
how big Tiedye would be one day.

<br />
But by January 2022, Tiedye was gone. The users had left, and we had moved on. What
happened?
<br />
<hr className="mt-4"></hr>
<br />
Probably the biggest contributing reason was that as in-person events began to
open up, people didn't need Tiedye anymore. Even though we had successfully
brought down the friction of meeting online friends, it just doesn't compare to
meeting friends in person. It took us a long time to come to terms with that
because Tiedye was our baby, but on a call one night, we realized that we had to
move on.

<br />
The second reason is that we realized there were ways to make Tiedye big - throw
money into hosting big popular parties so that Tiedye becomes a household name, organize
events ourselves, hire more to put boots on the ground. But the effort these initiatives
would take made us understand that our hearts weren't truly in the idea. We were
passionate about more than just helping college students meet friends. We wanted
to solve bigger problems, and day after day it seemed like the time invested in Tiedye
was time lost in growing and helping through other ways.

<br />
The last reason is that we realized being business partners wasn't great for our
relationships. Our relationship with our ambassadors and friends we had invited to
join in working on Tiedye became much more "business" than friendship, and we didn't
like that. Some of these friends were people we wanted to hang out with for a long
time whether Tiedye was around or not. But when Tiedye became the focus of every
conversation, it started to raise some red flags that the business was damaging our
relationships. You can't pull friends into a business and expect to remain just friends.

<br />
Overall, Tiedye was a rollercoaster ride and my first real crack at a running a company.
We didn't even get that big and it was still really hard work and more work than
I thought it would be. I learned so much by designing, architecting, shipping and
maintaining the app, and my personal bar went way up for how invested I would need
to be to found another company. Most of all, with a certain sense of irony, creating
Tiedye taught me personally how much I cherish my relationships and communities,
and I plan on keeping that lesson with me for the rest of my life.
