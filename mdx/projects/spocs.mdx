In 2019, my friends Justin Tackett, Daniel Mortenson and Jaxon Jones started BYU Commercial Space Club. It was Justin's idea. As good friends and eager nerds, we all jumped in. Justin saw that NASA was posting all sorts of calls for proposals, and he thought it would be fun if we took on NASA's SPOCS challenge with Citizen Science.

<br />

The goal was to come up with a proposal that would help with space travel by making systems more sustainable. Our idea was to use compliant mechanisms (think of origami) to make the spacecraft more efficient, lightweight, and cheaper to build. We finalist-ed, and attended the competition on Zoom, where we made a great presentation that we felt had great odds but it turned out we were beat by several biology based teams from UCLA and Stanford.

<br />
Presenting to NASA was one of the most intense things I've ever done, even though
I was just behind a screen. One of our team members was wearing gym shorts, haha.
But regardless of the outcome, we all learned a lot and had a great time.
