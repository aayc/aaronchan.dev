I've always been fascinated by the idea that machines can learn.  This is one of the simplest agents and simplest environments I could come up with when I was in high school.  In this environment, you can place green blocks which cause rewards to the agent if they cross them; red blocks which cause pain, and walls which are impassable.  

<br />
See how many steps it takes for the agent to learn how to be rewarded most by playing with it [here](https://thatnerd2.github.io/projects/rat-reward-js/index.html).
