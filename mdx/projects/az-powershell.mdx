<br />
During the summer of 2020, I interned for Microsoft remotely from my hometown in
Albany, NY. I put together a predictive experience for users of Azure PowerShell,
which is a set of Azure commands that you invoke in PowerShell. It became known as
Az Predictor. Read about it and see it in action [here](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-tools-blog/announcing-az-predictor/ba-p/1873104).
